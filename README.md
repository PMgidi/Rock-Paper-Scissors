Rock-Paper-Scissors

Introduction
Welcome to the Rock-Paper-Scissors game! This project implements a classic hand game that is often played between two players. The game is simple yet entertaining, making it a great way to pass the time.

How the Game Works
If you're unfamiliar with the game, here's a brief overview:

The game is played between two players (in this case, the user and the computer).
Each player can choose one of three options: rock, paper, or scissors.

The rules are as follows:
Rock crushes scissors (rock wins).
Scissors cuts paper (scissors wins).
Paper covers rock (paper wins).
If both players choose the same option, the game is a draw.
Project Description
In this implementation, the game is played between the user and the computer:

The computer randomly selects one of the three options: rock, paper, or scissors.
The user is prompted to make their choice.
The program compares the computer's choice with the user's choice to determine the outcome: win, lose, or draw.
Step 1: Computer's Random Choice
To make the computer randomly choose between rock, paper, or scissors, we will use the random module in Python. The process is as follows:

Generate a random integer between 1 and 3.
If the random number is 1, the computer's choice is rock.
If the random number is 2, the computer's choice is paper.
If the random number is 3, the computer's choice is scissors.
Getting Started
To run the game, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Ensure you have Python installed.
Run the game script using the command: python rock_paper_scissors.py.
